# gear_auditor

Gear auditor is a script that will extract your FFXI characters' inventory using data generated by the `findall` addon, compare it to items in your `GearSwap` luas, and identify any items not in use.

This project is a work in progress and I make no guarantees on its accuracy.  Please double-check before dropping any items you might still need.

### Planned Features

- Generate a spreadsheet with full inventory information for all characters
- Highlight items that could be moved to storage slips
- Highlight duplicate Sortie earrings
- Display POL sendable flag (identify mule-able items)
- Calculate number of shards and voids needed based on your current relic upgrade levels
- Generate checklists for Unity, HTMB, etc. (maybe?)

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Windower 4 installation with the `GearSwap` and `findall` addons installed
- `findall` must have been loaded at least once to generate the necessary inventory data
- GearSwap must contain one or more lua files applicable to your character (either prefixed with character's name or in the format of JOB.lua) 

#### How to Run

1. Download and install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and extract this repo (or git clone it)

4. Browse to and select your Windower folder when prompted
